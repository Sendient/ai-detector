# Code Best Practices

## General Practices

1. Use dependency injection
2. Keep functions small and focused
3. Use meaningful variable names
4. Comments explain _why_ not what
5. Add type hints to all functions
6. Use Pydantic for data validation
7. Use enums for fixed value sets
8. Document public APIs
9. Use async/await for I/O operations
10. Handle exceptions appropriately
11. Use logging for debugging

## Tools

1. Use `ruff` for linting and formatting
2. Use `pre-commit` for pre-commit hooks

## Configuration

See [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) for detailed linting and formatting rules.
