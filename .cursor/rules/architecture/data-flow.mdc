# Data Flow Architecture

## Request Flow

1. User requests enter through Platform API
2. Long-running tasks are queued via Queue Orchestrator
3. Queue Processor handles background processing
4. Results are stored and returned to users
5. Stats Collector tracks system metrics

## Integration Points

1. MongoDB for data storage
2. Azure Blob Storage for file storage
3. Azure Queues for message handling
4. AI models for processing
5. Stripe for payment processing

## Development Guidelines

1. New features should be implemented in the appropriate service
2. Use queues for long-running operations
3. Follow the established data flow patterns
4. Maintain separation of concerns
5. Use appropriate storage solutions for different data types
